## Project Title
AI-Driven Detection and Grading of Knee Osteoarthritis in Radiographic Data

## Objective
To develop a deep learning–based system for automated detection and KL grading of knee osteoarthritis using X-ray images.

## Dataset
- Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) – primary dataset
- MOST – backup dataset

## Methodology
- Transfer learning using CNN architectures (ResNet, DenseNet)
- Data augmentation and preprocessing
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Model interpretability using Grad-CAM

## Current Status
- Project structure and repository setup
- Dataset research completed
- Literature review initiated
- Initial notebooks created
