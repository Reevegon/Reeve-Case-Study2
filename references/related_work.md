# Related Work – Knee Osteoarthritis Detection

This file summarizes key research directions relevant to knee osteoarthritis (KOA) detection and grading using X-ray images.

## Deep Learning for KOA
CNN-based models have shown strong performance in KL grading tasks.
Transfer learning using ImageNet-pretrained networks is common.

## Transfer Learning
Architectures such as ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet are widely used.
Fine-tuning improves performance on medical imaging datasets.

## Explainability
Grad-CAM is commonly applied to highlight joint space narrowing and osteophytes.
Explainability is critical for clinical trust.

## Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are standard.
Some studies also report AUC and confusion matrices.

## Ongoing Review
Recent papers (last 3–5 years) are being reviewed to identify best-performing approaches.
