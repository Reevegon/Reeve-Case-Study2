# Dataset Exploration – Knee Osteoarthritis

## Primary Dataset: Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)

Modality: Knee X-ray images
Labels: Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) grades (0–4)
Scope: Large-scale longitudinal knee OA dataset
Usage: Widely used in knee osteoarthritis research
Access: Requires registration and approval

## Backup Datasets

### MOST (Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study)
Modality: Knee X-rays
Labels: KL grading available
Notes: Often used alongside OAI in literature

### Public/Kaggle Datasets
Availability: Various knee X-ray datasets with OA labels
Limitations: Smaller size, inconsistent annotations
Usage: Considered only as supplementary data

## Observations
Class imbalance is expected across KL grades
Image quality and acquisition settings vary
Preprocessing and augmentation will be required
